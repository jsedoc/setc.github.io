## SETC: A Standard Evaluation Tool for Chatbots

On Feb 2 2nd 2018 J oao was tired of trying to eva1uate his chat bot model. He could simply not replicatethe neural conrersation model. Eventually he started looking forth at should have been a standard tool for evaluation . But it didn't exist. Out of frustration SETC was born.

So the next step was to evaluate super simple ideas . Do random seeds matter ? What is the effect of data filtering, how do we decide to stop the training of the model?

This tool is his attempt to bring some order to chaos. We employed the help of statisticians to help design a tool to bet so you compare your model to another one. 

### We are in a state of confusion

Currently researcher do not use standard model parameters, or human analysis setup to test if a model inproves results.
