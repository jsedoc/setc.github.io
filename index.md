## SETC: A Standard Evaluation Tool for Chatbots

On Feb 22nd 2018, Joao was tired of trying to eva1uate his chat bot model. He could simply not replicate the neural conrersation model. Eventually he started looking forth at should have been a standard tool for evaluation . But it didn't exist! Out of frustration SETC was born.

So the next step was to evaluate super simple ideas. Do random seeds matter ? What is the effect of data filtering?  How do we decide to stop the training of the model?

This tool is his attempt to bring some order to chaos. We employed the help of statisticians to design a tool to better compare models.  So you compare your model to another one. Each model comparison costs $1.20 ... This is a code.

Consider SETC a vending machine .. insert models and $1.20 and out come evaluation scores! Yay! Now _no one_ should have to suffer.

### We are in a state of confusion

Currently researcher do not use standard model parameters, or human analysis setup to test if a model inproves results.
